# IoTEdgeConnection
 Internet of Things workshop conducted on 12th December 2020 in association with Etisalat Digital and PTC.  In this workshop, we will show you how to connect devices on the edge to the ThingWorx Cloud — syncing up data from the edge to digital representations on the cloud seamlessly using the proprietary two-way WebSockets-based AlwaysOn protocol, implemented using the ThingWorx Edge MicroServer tool.  In our scenario, we’ll simulate an engine on our edge device that generates values to predict failure. We’ll build a quick web dashboard as well to present the data.  Prerequisites: Activate your free PTC Cloud trial developer account - https://developer.thingworx.com/en/resources/trials (No download required)
